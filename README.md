# CircleBuilder

This project is mainly devided in two phases.

**Phase 1**

- more or less done
  
Building a solid App as a foundation for phase 2. 
Basically a user can draw a path in a matrix of touchable objects. All free fields should be activated and the first and
last division should lay next to each other.
Several fields can be blocked by barriers, which can not be activated and must be build arround.

**Phase 2**

- will prob. start working on this aspect july/august

Find the math whether an arrangement of barries makes a game solvable or not. Idealy this can be 
implemented as a more or less random barrier-creating algorithm.
